Create the google form, asking for people to upload their version of the template. Also get social media links and their profile blurb.

Download these files to your server. Make a directory called rooms.

In rooms directory:  Each entry is identified by their number XX. Copy each user's template image to a new room by renaming their file roomXX.png, their info (include social media links) to roomXX.html, and  their headshot to headshotXX.png.

Then, update maxRoom variable in the parent directory index.html to the number of rooms.
