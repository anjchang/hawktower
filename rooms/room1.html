<p>Hi I'm Angela Chang! This semester, I teach Comm165 Intro to Visual Communications. Though my eyrie isn't as colorful as this, it has a gorgeous view of nearby woods. My walls are adorned with colorful artwork made by my children. <br> Outside of classes, I'm an editor for the <a href="http://taper.badquar.to">taper digital poetry ezine</a> and <a href="http://tinkerstories.com">TinkerStories</a>.  I am also involved with the <a href="https://descience26.carbonmade.com/projects/5166695"> electronic fashion</a> and like to make things digital and physical.  Fun fact: My work is often inspired by science fiction. This project reminds me of the Raft described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">SnowCrash<a/>.</p>
